        I go by @thatbellymonster on the internet when it relates to anything to do with this fetish (or these fetishes).
        I think of myself as more of a sadist than a Dom, but I do enjoy both. 
        This is an idea I have had for awhile, to create a social media platform where other belly fetishists like myself can interact and share with each other. 
        On this site, you can share photos, videos, stories and discussions. 
        You can navigate by pressing the words at the very top of every page.
        You are welcome to share and promote your own content as well.
        Eventually, I'd like to incorporate a store feature for creators to sell their work straight from here.
        If there are ever any questions or concerns, you can find where to reach me on the contact page.
